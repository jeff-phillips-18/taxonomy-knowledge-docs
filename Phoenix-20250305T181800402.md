## Phoenix (constellation)

Phoenix is  a  minor  constellation  in  the  southern  sky. Named after the mythical phoenix, it was first depicted on  a  celestial  atlas  by  Johann  Bayer  in  his  1603 Uranometria . The  French  explorer  and  astronomer Nicolas Louis de Lacaille charted the brighter stars and gave their Bayer designations in 1756. The constellation stretches from  roughly  -39°  to  -57° declination, and from 23.5h to 2.5h of right ascension. The  constellations  Phoenix,  Grus,  Pavo  and  Tucana, are known as the Southern Birds.

The  brightest  star, Alpha  Phoenicis,  is  named Ankaa, an Arabic word meaning 'the Phoenix'. It is an orange giant of apparent magnitude 2.4. Next is Beta Phoenicis,  actually  a  binary  system  composed  of  two yellow giants with a combined apparent magnitude of 3.3. Nu Phoenicis has a dust disk, while the constellation has ten star systems with known planets and  the  recently  discovered  galaxy  clusters  El  Gordo and  the  Phoenix  Cluster-located  7.2  and  5.7  billion light years away respectively, two of the largest objects in  the  visible  universe.  Phoenix  is  the  radiant  of  two annual  meteor  showers:  the  Phoenicids  in  December, and the July Phoenicids.

## History

Phoenix was the largest of the 12 constellations established by Petrus Plancius from the observations of Pieter Dirkszoon Keyser and Frederick de Houtman. It first appeared  on  a  35-cm  diameter  celestial  globe published in 1597 (or 1598) in Amsterdam by Plancius with  Jodocus  Hondius.  The  first  depiction  of  this constellation in a celestial atlas was in Johann Bayer's Uranometria of 1603. [2] De Houtman included it in his southern  star  catalog  the  same  year  under  the  Dutch name Den  voghel  Fenicx , "The  Bird Phoenix", [3] symbolising the phoenix of classical mythology. [4] One name of the brightest star Alpha Phoenicis-Ankaa-

Coelestis , ca. 1742

romanized: al-'anqā' , lit. 'the phoenix', and was coined sometime after 1800 in relation to the constellation. [5]

Celestial  historian  Richard Allen  noted  that  unlike  the  other constellations introduced by Plancius and La Caille, Phoenix has actual precedent in ancient astronomy, as the Arabs saw this formation as representing young ostriches, Al Ri'āl , or as a griffin or eagle. [6] In addition, the same group of stars was sometimes imagined by the Arabs as a boat, Al Zaurak , on the nearby river Eridanus. [7] He observed, "the introduction of a Phoenix  into  modern  astronomy  was,  in  a  measure,  by adoption rather than by invention." [6]

The Chinese incorporated Phoenix's brightest star, Ankaa (Alpha Phoenicis), and stars from the adjacent constellation  Sculptor  to  depict Bakui , a  net  for  catching  birds. [4] Phoenix  and  the  neighbouring constellation of Grus together were seen by Julius Schiller as portraying Aaron the High Priest. [6] These two constellations, along with nearby Pavo and Tucana, are called the Southern Birds. [8]

## Characteristics

Phoenix is a small constellation bordered by Fornax and Sculptor to the north, Grus to the west, Tucana to the  south,  touching  on  the  corner  of  Hydrus  to  the  south,  and  Eridanus  to  the  east  and  southeast. The bright  star Achernar  is  nearby. [9] The  three-letter  abbreviation  for  the  constellation,  as  adopted  by  the International Astronomical Union in 1922, is "Phe". [10] The official constellation boundaries, as set by Belgian astronomer Eugène Delporte in 1930, are defined by a polygon of 10 segments. In the equatorial coordinate system, the right ascension coordinates of these borders lie between 23  26.5 h m  and 02  25.0 h m  , while the declination coordinates are between -39.31° and -57.84°. [1] This means it remains below the horizon to anyone living north of the 40th parallel in the Northern Hemisphere, and remains low in the sky for anyone living north of the equator. It is most visible from locations such as Australia and South is derived from the Arabic: اﻟﻌﻨﻘﺎء ,

Africa  during  late  Southern  Hemisphere  spring. [7] Most  of  the  constellation  lies  within,  and  can  be located by, forming a triangle of the bright stars Achernar, Fomalhaut and Beta Ceti-Ankaa lies roughly in the centre of this. [11]

## Features

## Stars

A curved line of stars comprising Alpha, Kappa, Mu, Beta, Nu and Gamma Phoenicis was seen as a boat by the ancient Arabs. [6] French  explorer  and  astronomer  Nicolas  Louis  de Lacaille  charted  and  designated  27  stars  with  the  Bayer designations Alpha through to Omega in 1756. Of these, he labelled  two  stars  close  together  Lambda,  and  assigned Omicron,  Psi  and  Omega  to  three  stars,  which  subsequent astronomers  such  as  Benjamin  Gould  felt  were  too  dim  to warrant their letters. A  different star was  subsequently labelled Psi Phoenicis, while the other two designations fell out of use. [12]

Ankaa is the brightest star in the constellation. It is an orange giant  of  apparent  visual  magnitude  2.37  and  spectral  type K0.5IIIb, [13] 77 light years distant from Earth and orbited by a  secondary  object  about  which  little  is  known. [14] Lying close by Ankaa is Kappa Phoenicis, a main sequence star of spectral type A5IVn and apparent magnitude 3.90. [15] Located  centrally  in  the  asterism, [7] Beta  Phoenicis  is  the second brightest star in the constellation and another binary

star. Together the stars, both yellow giants of spectral type G8, shine with an apparent magnitude of 3.31, though the components are of individual apparent magnitudes of 4.0 and 4.1 and orbit each other every 168 years. [16] Zeta Phoenicis or Wurren [17] is an Algol-type eclipsing binary, with an apparent magnitude fluctuating between 3.9 and 4.4 with a period of around 1.7 days (40 hours); its dimming results from the component two blue-white B-type stars, which orbit and block out each other from Earth. The two stars are 0.05 AU from each other, while a third star is around 600 AU away from the pair, and has an orbital period exceeding 5000 years. [18] The system is around 300 light years distant. [19] In  1976,  researchers Clausen, Gyldenkerne, and Grønbech calculated that a nearby 8th magnitude star is a fourth member of the system. [20]

AI  Phe  is  an  eclipsing  binary  star  identified  in  1972.  Its  long  mutual  eclipses  and  combination  of spectroscopic and astrometric data allows precise measurement of the masses and radii of the stars [21] which is viewed as a potential cross-check on stellar properties and distances independent on Ceiphid Variables and such techniques. The long eclipse events require space-based observations to avoid Solar interference. Gamma Phoenicis is a red giant of spectral type M0IIIa [22] and varies between magnitudes 3.39 and 3.49. It lies 235 light years away. [23] Psi Phoenicis is another red giant, this time of spectral type M4III, [24] and  has  an  apparent  magnitude that ranges between 4.3 and 4.5 over a period of around 30

days. [25] Lying 340 light years away, [24] it has around 85 times the diameter, but only 85% of the mass, of the Sun. [26] W Phoenicis is a Mira variable, ranging from magnitude 8.1 to 14.4 over 333.95 days. A red giant, its spectrum ranges between M5e and M6e. [27] Located 6.5 degrees west of Ankaa is SX Phoenicis, a variable star which ranges from magnitude 7.1 to 7.5 over a period of a mere 79 minutes. Its spectral type  varies  between  A2  and  F4. [28] It  gives  its  name  to  a  group  of  stars  known  as  SX  Phoenicis variables. [29] Rho and BD Phoenicis are Delta Scuti variables-short period (six hours at most) pulsating stars that have been used as standard candles and as subjects to study astroseismology. [30] Rho is spectral type F2III, [31] and ranges between magnitudes 5.20 and 5.26 over a period of 2.85 hours. [32] BD is of spectral type A1V, [33] and ranges between magnitudes 5.90 and 5.94. [34]

Nu Phoenicis is a yellow-white main sequence star of spectral type F9V and magnitude 4.96. [35] Lying some 49 light years distant, it is around 1.2 times as massive as the Sun, [36] and likely to be surrounded by  a  disk  of  dust. [37] It  is  the  closest  star  in  the  constellation  that  is  visible  with  the  unaided  eye. [25] Gliese 915 is a white dwarf only 26 light years away. It is of magnitude 13.05, too faint to be seen with the  naked  eye. [38] White  dwarfs  are  extremely  dense  stars  compacted  into  a  volume  the  size  of  the Earth. [39] With around 85% of the mass of the Sun, Gliese 915 has a surface gravity of 10 8.39 ± 0.01 (2.45 · 10 8 ) cm·s -2 , or approximately 250,000 of Earth's. [40]

Ten stars have been found to have planets to date, and four planetary systems have been discovered with the SuperWASP project. HD 142 is a yellow giant that has an apparent magnitude of 5.7, and has a planet (HD 142 b) 1.36 times the mass of Jupiter which orbits every 328 days. [41] HD 2039 is a yellow subgiant with an apparent magnitude of 9.0 around 330 light years away which has a planet (HD 2039 b) six times the mass of Jupiter. WASP-18 is a star of magnitude 9.29 which was discovered to have a hot Jupiter-like planet  (WASP-18b)  taking  less  than  a  day  to  orbit  the  star. [42] The  planet  is  suspected  to  be  causing WASP-18 to appear older than it really is. [43] WASP-4 and WASP-5 are solar-type yellow stars around 1000 light years distant and of 13th magnitude, each with a single planet larger than Jupiter. [44] WASP-29 is an orange dwarf of spectral type K4V and visual magnitude 11.3, which has a planetary companion of similar size and mass to Saturn. The planet completes an orbit every 3.9 days. [45]

WISE J003231.09-494651.4 and WISE J001505.87-461517.6 are two brown dwarfs discovered by the Wide-field  Infrared  Survey  Explorer,  and  are  63  and  49  light  years  away  respectively. [46] Initially hypothesised  before  they  were  belatedly  discovered, [47] brown  dwarfs  are  objects  more  massive  than planets, but which are of insufficient mass for hydrogen fusion characteristic of stars to occur. Many are being found by sky surveys. [48]

Phoenix contains HE0107-5240, possibly one of the oldest stars yet discovered. It has around 1/200,000 the metallicity that the Sun has and hence must have formed very early in the history of the universe. [49] With a visual magnitude of 15.17, [50] it is around 10,000 times dimmer than the faintest stars visible to the naked eye and is 36,000 light years distant. [49]

## Deep-sky objects

The constellation does not lie on the galactic plane of the Milky Way, and there are no prominent star clusters. [9] NGC 625 is a dwarf irregular galaxy of apparent magnitude 11.0 and lying some 12.7 million light years distant. Only 24000 light years in diameter, it is an outlying member of the Sculptor Group. NGC 625  is  thought  to  have  been  involved  in  a  collision  and  is  experiencing  a  burst  of  active  star formation. [51] NGC  37  is  a  lenticular  galaxy  of  apparent  magnitude  14.66.  It  is  approximately  42

kiloparsecs  (137,000  light-years)  in  diameter  and  about  12.9  billion  years  old. [52] Robert's  Quartet (composed of the irregular galaxy NGC 87, and three spiral galaxies NGC 88, NGC 89 and NGC 92) is a group of four galaxies located around 160 million light-years away which are in the process of colliding and  merging.  They  are  within  a  circle  of  radius  of  1.6  arcmin,  corresponding  to  about  75,000  lightyears. [53] Located in the galaxy ESO 243-49 is HLX-1, an intermediate-mass black hole-the first one of its kind identified. It is thought to be a remnant of a dwarf galaxy that was absorbed in a collision with ESO 243-49. Before its discovery, this class of black hole was only hypothesized. [54]

Lying within the bounds of the constellation is the gigantic Phoenix cluster, which is around 7.3 million light years wide and 5.7 billion light years away, making it one of the most massive galaxy clusters. It was first discovered in 2010, and the central galaxy is producing an estimated 740 new stars a year. [55] Larger still is El Gordo, or officially ACT-CL J0102-4915, whose discovery was announced in 2012. [56] Located around 7.2 billion light years away, it is composed of two subclusters in the process of colliding, resulting in the spewing out of hot gas, seen in X-rays and infrared images. [57]

## Meteor showers

Phoenix  is  the  radiant  of  two  annual  meteor  showers.  The  Phoenicids,  also  known  as  the  December Phoenicids, were first observed on 3 December 1887. The shower was particularly intense in December 1956, and is thought related to the breakup of the short-period comet 289P/Blanpain. It peaks around 4-5 December, though is not seen every year. [58] A  very  minor  meteor  shower  peaks  around  July  14  with around one meteor an hour, though meteors can be seen anytime from July 3 to 18; this shower is referred to as the July Phoenicids. [59]
